Salary Theft Simulator — VR Interaction & Environmental Storytelling Project

A VR game prototype exploring workplace satire, stealth interactions, and immersive environmental design.

🎮 Overview

Salary Theft Simulator is a virtual-reality experience built in Unity that places the player inside an exaggerated, satirical office environment. The goal is simple: slack off without getting caught. Players must interact with objects, complete mischievous tasks, and navigate the workplace while avoiding detection from supervisors and surveillance systems.

This project focuses on VR interaction design, spatial user experience, and environmental storytelling, simulating how subtle motion, sound, and physical affordances shape player behavior inside immersive spaces.

✨ Key Features
